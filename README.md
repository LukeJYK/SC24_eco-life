## ECO-LIFE: High Performance and Carbon-Aware Serverless Workloads Scheduling via Multi-generation Hardware (SC24-AD/AE)

## Description
Eco-Life applies a customized Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to execute serverless function workloads based on multi-generation hardware. The goal is to co-optimize service time (both the execution time and cold start time) and carbon footprint (embodied carbon footprint and operational carbon footprint during both the execution period and keep-alive period).
